## 🌍 Problem Statement

Imagine Maria, a brilliant student in Brazil, eager to learn data science from a top English-speaking professor on YouTube. For years, the language barrier was an insurmountable wall.

But now, with **EduBridge AI**, that wall crumbles.

Maria clicks play, and as the professor speaks, a clear, natural voice in Portuguese seamlessly narrates, perfectly in sync. She’s not just reading subtitles — she’s hearing and learning directly, as if the lecture was always meant for her.

This isn’t just translation; it’s a bridge to global education, built with advanced AI to:

- Transcribe spoken content in real time  
- Translate it into multiple languages  
- Generate synchronized voice narration  

Creating a truly inclusive learning experience for everyone.
